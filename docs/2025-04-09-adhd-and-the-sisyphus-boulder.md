# For those who say ADHD is a blessing, I ask: "Was the boulder a blessing for Sisyphus?"

Like Sisyphus eternally pushing his boulder uphill only to watch it roll back down, untreated ADHD in the tech industry has been my personal boulder - painful, constant, and seemingly impossible to overcome.

I've had moments of significant professional achievement - being a youngest-ever hire at a major company, single-handedly building complex software systems with innovative security architecture, and thriving in roles where I could leverage my natural strengths. The capabilities were always there.

Yet for years, shame pushed me to struggle in silence with things many take for granted:

* Maintaining focus in meetings
* Remembering crucial information from discussions
* Consistently logging hours and administrative tasks
* Processing written documentation effectively
* Reading and comprehending code
* Maintaining emotional regulation under normal workplace pressure
* Keeping design or architecture in mind

The most insidious part? The gap between what I knew I could do and what I was increasingly unable to do. My confidence evaporated as symptoms worsened, and I began hiding my struggles, trying to operate solely on previously acquired knowledge.

The pandemic, while working remotely with family responsibilities, became a breaking point. My deteriorating ability to function was met with some understanding, initially, but that good will was short lived - increasingly, I heard I was "lazy" and "just needed to work harder."

I tried pushing through. Twice I forced myself back into positions I wasn't ready for. Twice I failed, further damaging my professional confidence and career.

It took over three years to receive adequate treatment. Three years that significantly impacted my career trajectory and sense of self. During that time, I existed only in the present moment - I have few memories of those years. I felt disconnected from my own life and capabilities.

With proper treatment, the transformation has been remarkable:

* Clarity of thought returned
* Communication became effective again
* Sleep normalized
* Emotional regulation improved
* Reading and retention massively improved
* Massively increased attention span
* And perhaps most importantly - I began forming memories again

The evidence of this change? Completed personal projects and effective (re)learning leading to successful interviews. The skills were always there. They were just obscured by untreated ADHD.

If you're struggling with undiagnosed or untreated ADHD, please know your experience is valid. You're not suddenly less capable or committed. Your brain works differently, and that difference requires appropriate support.

And if you manage or work alongside neurodivergent colleagues - please lead with empathy. Behind performance struggles may be a person with tremendous capabilities fighting an invisible battle.
